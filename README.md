# My Houses

##### To run launch application

1. Open project in code editor
2. Install npm
    ```sh
    > install npm
    ```
3. Start application
    ```sh
    > ng serve --open
    ```

##### To test application

Run the following command

```sh
> ng test
```

##### Check the checkboxes to filter out other lists.
Could be implemented other lists 'onChange' events as well, but they would work the same as first one, so I saved some time on coding that.

**Thank you!**
